first start the bank server - server-bankrmi
then start the market server - marketServer
now you can start client - tradeClient

you can create user, login to your account
after login you can list, sell, buy items. wish function is not implemented yet
user balance is stored in user table according to project description but 
it would be better to create a seperate table for balance and bank account details
